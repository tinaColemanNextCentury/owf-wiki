##Connecting to Marketplace
Marketplace, similar to a commercial application store, operates as a thin-client registry of applications and services. Marketplace allows administrators to connect to multiple Marketplaces by creating widgets that are stored under the Marketplace button on the toolbar. 

To enable the Marketplace button on the toolbar, an administrator has to create a Marketplace widget. To do this, follow these instructions:

1.	Sign in to OWF as an administrator.
2.	Click the ![Administration Button](https://github.com/ozoneplatform/owf/wiki/OWFImages/OWF7/OZONE_widget_button.png) button on the toolbar and select Widgets.
3.	Click Create and complete all the fields, <b>change the Widget Type field to Marketplace.</b>
4.	Click Apply.
5.	When you refresh OWF, the Marketplace button will appear on the toolbar. Repeat the process for each different Marketplace connection.
