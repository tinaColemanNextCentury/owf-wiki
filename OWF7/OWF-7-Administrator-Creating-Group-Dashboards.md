##Creating Group Dashboards
Group dashboards allow members of a group to have identical copies of a dashboard. Similar to the OWF Users Group, administrators can use group dashboards to give different groups of users the same starting screen or access to widgets. Each user can customize their instance of the group dashboard. Those changes will ONLY affect that user’s instance of the dashboard. Users can return their dashboard to the current state of the group dashboard by clicking the ![Restore](https://github.com/ozoneplatform/owf/wiki/OWFImages/OWF7/Restore_icon.png) button (found by clicking Manage on the Switcher, then choosing the dashboard). If an administrator changed the group dashboard after it was added to a user’s instance of OWF, the current state of the dashboard may be different than the one that originally appeared on the user’s navigation bar.
> _Note: If a group dashboard is deleted by an administrator, the users’ copies of that dashboard will remain available to the users. However, the restore feature will no longer be available for the dashboard._ 

To create a group dashboard:

1.	Click the ![Administration Button](https://github.com/ozoneplatform/owf/wiki/OWFImages/OWF7/administration_button.png) button on the toolbar.
2.	Open the Group Dashboards Manager.
    * A.	Select an existing dashboard and click Edit.
    * B.	Click Create to make a new dashboard.
3.	Customize the fields on the Properties tab, then click Apply.
4.	To add a group, select the Groups tab and click Add. Select the group you want to add, then click OK.
5.	Close the window. Each user in the selected group will see the dashboard in the dashboard switcher on their toolbar.
