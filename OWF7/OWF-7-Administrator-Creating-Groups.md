##Creating Groups
Groups allow administrators to easily add or remove widgets, dashboards and stacks to and from multiple users’ instances of OWF. For example, by putting 10 employees into a group, the administrator can send 1 dashboard or 1 widget to the group, rather than having to individually add the widget to ten employees.  

The following serves as a walkthrough for documentation purposes only. To create groups in OWF and to add users to that group:

1.	Click the ![Administration Button](OWFImages/OWF7/administration_button.png) button on the toolbar.
2.	Click the Groups button to open the Groups Manager.
3.	From the manager, click the Create button. This will launch the Group Editor.
4.	Fill in the appropriate data on the Properties tab. Once the Apply button is clicked, the other tabs on the Group Editor will become active. Note the following:

  A. If the display name field is populated, that is the name which will appear in all administrator panels. The only way for the primary name field to appear is to leave the display name field blank.

  B. If an administrator checks the automatic box in the User Management field, the following will happen:
   * i.	The name of the group will not be editable.
   * ii. The users tab will remain grayed out as users can only be added via external sources, such as a security plug-in.

5.	Add users to the group by selecting the Users tab, clicking the Add button and selecting users from the grid.  
6.	The Widgets and Dashboards tabs behave the same way and can be used to populate groups accordingly.
