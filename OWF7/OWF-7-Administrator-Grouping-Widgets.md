##Grouping Widgets
Administrators can use groups, group dashboards and default tags to categorize and separate widgets on users’ Launch Menus. Administrators add widgets to a dashboard and then give group(s) access to that dashboard to group widgets via the group dashboard feature explained on the [Creating Group Dashboards](OWF-7-Administrator-Creating-Group-Dashboards). Administrators also use groups and default tags to group widgets. Information about adding widgets to groups and default tags is found in the following sections.

###Adding Widgets to a Group
When a user is part of a group, for example Group A, the user’s Launch Menu will display the widgets assigned to Group A in the main section of the Launch Menu. A list of the user’s group displays in the left panel. By checking the box to the left of the group name, the Launch Menu and Favorites Pane will only display widgets that are associated with the group, as shown below. Only an administrator can make changes to widgets that are part of a group. Users cannot edit or delete the group or the widgets in it.

To add widgets to a group:

1.	Click the ![Administration Button](OWFImages/OWf7/administration_button.png)  button on the toolbar.
2.	Click the Groups button. Select an existing group and click Edit.
3.	The Group Editor will launch. Select the Widgets tab.
4.	Click Add to select widgets that will be assigned to the group, then click OK.
5.	Close the Group Editor.

###Adding Default Tags
The **Adding Widgets to a Group** section describes one method administrators can organize widgets for users in a group. Administrators can also add Default Tags to widgets to categorize them on all users’ Launch Menus. 
To add a Default Tag:

1.	Click the ![Administration Button](OWFImages/OWF7/administration_button.png) button on the toolbar.
2.	Click the Widget button to launch the Widget Manager. Then, select a Widget.
3.	Click Edit to open the Widget Editor.
4.	Add a Default Tag, then click Apply.
5.	Close the Widget Editor window. In every user’s Launch Menu, the widget will appear in the newly created Default Tag category. 

In addition to Default Tags, users can add their own tags to widgets. The user-applied tags will only appear in the user’s instance of OWF. 
> _Note: Default tags are not applied to Administration, Marketplace or Metrics widgets. Also, if a default tag is added to a widget after the widget is assigned to a user (visible in their Launch Menu), the Default Tag will not apply unless the widget is deleted from the user’s instance and reassigned to the user._
