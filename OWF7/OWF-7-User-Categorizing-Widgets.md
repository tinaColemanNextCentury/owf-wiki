# Categorizing Widgets

Users have two tools to categorize and separate widgets in their Launch Menu: Tags and Groups. Widgets can have several tags or be part of several groups. While a user or an administrator can add tags to a widget, only an administrator can add a widget to a group. Both tools are visible when the Advanced Search Pane is expanded in the Launch Menu.

## Tags

Tags are used to group, categorize and separate widgets. They display in a tag cloud formation in the Advanced Search Panel on the Launch Menu. Tags that are used more frequently (by an administrator or user) appear in a larger font. To refine a search using tags, click on the tag and the Launch Menu will filter to only display widgets that include that tag. 
To add Tags to a widget:

1.	From the toolbar, click the ![Settings Button](https://github.com/ozoneplatform/owf/wiki/OWFImages/OWF7/settings_button_18px.png)  button and choose Widgets. This will open the Widget Settings window. 
2.	Click the Tags column which will open a text box. 
3.	Type the word that will be used to categorize widgets. (To add several Tags, separate them with commas.) 
4.	Click away from the text box, and then click OK. 

For example, a user can tag widgets with the word “monitor.” When a user clicks on the word monitor in the tag cloud, only widgets with this tag will display in the center section of the Launch Menu.

## Groups

All of the user’s groups are listed on the Advanced Search Panel on the Launch Menu. Administrators assign users to groups to provide access to widgets and dashboards. By checking the box to the left of the group name, the Launch Menu and Favorites Pane will only display widgets that are associated with the group. To remove the filters, click Reset at the bottom of the Advanced Search Panel.

##Favorites Pane

The Favorites Pane comprises the lower portion of the Launch Menu. Users can move widgets into it and access them without searching through all the widgets in the main section of the Launch Menu. To add widgets to the Favorites Pane, drag them down from the main section of the Launch Menu to the pane. Widgets will appear in the Favorites Pane when the Launch Menu opens. 

* To resize the Favorites Pane, drag the top bar up or down. 
* To reorder widgets in the pane, drag them left or right.
* To view widgets that cannot fit on the screen, click the left or right arrows.
* To remove widgets from the pane, drag them back to the main section of the Launch Menu.
