This guide is written for users of the OWF application.

##3   OWF Overview

###Widgets
A widget is a lightweight, single-purpose application that offers a summary or limited view of a larger application. In OWF, a widget is a global description for a piece of Web content that can be configured by the user and displayed within a dashboard. Please see the [Widgets](OWF-7-User-Widgets) page for general information about widgets. Additional information is also available on [Removing, Renaming and Reordering Widgets](OWF-7-Users-Removing-Renaming-Reordering-Widgets) and [Accessing Widgets from Marketplace](OWF-7-Users-Accessing-Marketplace).

###Dashboards 
A dashboard is a user-defined template where widgets are added, arranged and used by the user. Dashboards have a customized layout or layouts that serves to organize loaded widgets, helping the overall function of a user's workflow. Once saved, a dashboard will load with the same interface and widget layout as the last time it was accessed by a specific user. 

Also available in OWF are group dashboards. The group dashboard feature provides identical dashboards for each member of a group. Each group member can customize their instance of a pre-configured dashboard. All dashboards and their respective configurations are limitless; a user can have any number of dashboards, all of which render and function independently. More information on adding, deleting and customizing dashboards is found on the [Dashboards](OWF-7-Users-Dashboards) page.

###Stacks
Stacks are simply a collection of dashboards. Users and groups are assigned to a stack by an administrator. Once assigned, users are able access, share and restore the associated widgets and dashboards. Information about stacks is found on the [Stacks](OWF-7-Users-Stacks) page.
