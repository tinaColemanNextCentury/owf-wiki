#Keyboard Navigation
##508 Compliance

The OWF team is striving toward creating an accessible product for people with disabilities. To meet federal accessibility standards the OWF team added two high-contrast background themes and one large text theme. OWF also provides keyboard navigation that enables users to navigate the framework without a mouse. The OWF Bundle includes supporting documentation that is provided in Adobe Acrobat PDF file format. All changes are done in accordance with [Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act](http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=1998Amend). For accessibility issues that cannot be remedied by a system administrator, contact the OWF Community Support Team. 

> _Note: While OWF created an accessible framework, it is the responsibility of each organization’s widget developers (not the OWF team) to create and maintain widgets that meet accessibility requirements._

##Keyboard Navigation
<b>Keyboard navigation</b> – the users’ ability to interact with an application using only a keyboard for input (no mouse).  

OWF supports keyboard navigation in the toolbar, all dashboard layouts and content fields in widgets. 

This section explains:

* <b>Global Keyboard Combination and Navigation</b>

* <b>Widget Switcher</b> – The widget switcher (accessed by Alt + Shift + Q) lists active widgets on a dashboard.
* <b>Dashboard Layout Specific Navigation </b>– Special key combinations that support OWF specific dashboard layouts (Tabs, Accordion, Desktop, Portal and Fit).

* <b>Widget Focus</b> – An overview about focusing widgets and the tools used to do it.

#2   Global Key Combinations and Navigation 

OWF’s global key mapping feature is based on key sequences Alt + Shift + any predetermined hot key. The OWF team purposely chose this key sequence to avoid combinations that are commonly used in well-known operating systems and browsers.

#4  Widget Focus
##Defining Widget Focus
Focus refers to the element on the screen that is active. In a word processing document, the blinking cursor cues the user as to where the document is focused. To focus using a mouse, the user clicks. This section explains how focus passes from one element to the next in a widget using keyboard navigation via the Tab key. 

###Focus Frame Visibility
Through keyboard navigation, OWF identifies focused elements while hiding unnecessary focus borders. Generally, focus will move clockwise through the window. However, some components in the interface use other methods of focusing, as denoted in the following sections. 

###Grids
When working in grids, focus is denoted by showing the active style on the selected row of the grid. If a row was NOT previously selected, the first row will be selected by default.

###Widget Icons
In all places in the OWF user interface where widgets are referenced by their icon, the “selected” style also functions as the focus style shown below:

![Focused Widget Example](OWFImages/OWF7/focused_widget_example.png)

<b>Figure: Focused Widget Example in Launch Menu</b>

##Widget Focus Instructions

In OWF, a user can focus several parts of a widget. Generally, users can use standard navigate (Shift + Tab or Tab) to navigate to the different parts. Elements in a widget usually focus in this order: 

1.	Widget Title
2.	Widget Chrome Buttons (close, maximize, minimize, etc). This includes buttons and menus added using the Widget Chrome API
3.	Any other elements within the widget that are focusable
4.	Widget Body (as shown below)
5.	Return to the Widget Title

###Widget Focus Tips
* 	To activate elements within the widget header (the title and chrome buttons):  Focus on the element and then press the enter button.  
*	To quickly navigate in a clockwise direction through the widget body:  Use the tab key.
*	To switch from the widget body to the widget title:  Press Esc.
*	To leave the widget:  Press Alt + Shift + W or Press Esc twice or select a different widget from the widget switcher (Alt + Shift + Q) or the Launch Menu (Alt + Shift + L).
*	To return to the toolbar:  Press Esc twice. 

###Expanding a Minimized or Collapsed Widget
To expand a widget after it has been minimized to the taskbar or collapsed in a dashboard; select it using the Widget Switcher (Alt + Shift + Q).  When a widget is restored from a minimized or collapsed state, the widget body focuses.  

#5 Toolbar Focus

The OWF Toolbar spans the length of the browser window. The left portion of it is detachable. From there, users can launch widgets, switch dashboards, connect to Marketplace (if one is configured), change their settings, access help, and detach/reattach the toolbar. The right portion of the toolbar consists of the drop-down User Menu which includes the last sign in time, user profile information and OWF product information and the sign out feature. 

Important things to remember about the toolbar:

*	Pressing Esc from anywhere in the application will return the user to the toolbar. (If a widget or window is in focus, the user may have to press Esc twice to return focus to the toolbar.)
*	The toolbar focuses in a circular repetition. After cycling through the last choice on the drop-down User Menu, focus returns to the Launch Menu. 
*	The following table lists keyboard combinations for the detachable toolbar elements (including administration controls that are only visible to an administrator) and Sign Out. Other toolbar elements (the profile and about windows) are only accessed by tabbing through the attached OWF Toolbar.
